Welcome to the Car Game! This game challenges your reflexes and coordination as you navigate a car to avoid falling stones.

# Features
**Dynamic Gameplay:** Stones appear at random intervals and move down the screen, increasing the challenge.

**Responsive Controls:** Move your car left or right using on-screen buttons to dodge the stones.

**Collision Detection:** Accurate collision detection ensures that any contact between the car and a stone results in a crash.

**Lives System:** You start with three lives. Each collision costs you a life, and the game ends when you run out of lives.

**RTL Support:** The game supports both LTR (left-to-right) and RTL (right-to-left) layouts, adapting to the device's language settings.
